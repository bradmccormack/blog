I&#8217;ve only got a 60GB SSD as the internal storage on this iMac. I figured it was time to make some more space on it.
  
I&#8217;ve got an external USB drive for longer term storage but I want more space on the SSD so she can keep the performance up.

Here are some things I tried which were quite useful.

  * [Remove Documentation that you probably won&#8217;t use anyway from XCode][1]
  * [Remove Language packs and various CPU Architectures that you don&#8217;t use via Monlingual][2]
  * [More selective removal of Universal binary that is not required][3]

Between these few alone I shaved a few GB.

Note &#8211; You will also have to manually find things to delete and I strongly recommend [Grand Perspective][5] for this.
