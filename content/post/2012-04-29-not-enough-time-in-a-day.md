So today I had many aspirations &#8230;

### Get grub updated to Grub 2 on Arch Linux (Done)

  * <pre>(Something went wrong here and I had to find a spare Arch Live CD laying around and Chroot into the existing install .... something along the lines of ..</pre>

  * <pre>mkdir /media/arch</pre>

  * <pre>mount /dev/sda1 /media/arch</pre>

  * <pre>mount -t proc /proc /media/arch/proc</pre>

  * <pre>mount -t sysfs /sys /media/arch/sys</pre>

  * <pre>mount -o bind /dev /media/arch/dev</pre>

  * <pre>¬†chroot /media/arch /bin/bash</pre>
    
    <pre>(N.B Don't use a live cd of a different cpu architecture than the chrooted environment (a.ka X86 vs X86-64) You will have issues.

</pre>

### Get a new kernel supporting SFS or at least a module ready so that I could chain load Aros via Grub 2 (!Done)

  * It seems I&#8217;ll have to re-partition to get around Aros&#8217;s short-comings in regards to partitioning schemes and Grub. If you are wondering what Aros is take a look here¬†[So today I had many aspirations &#8230;

### Put my first attempts at an Md5 OpenCL based hasher onto github.

  * I&#8217;m still going with this. I&#8217;m quite¬†embarrassed¬†with my current attempt. I&#8217;ve spent too long with C#, Java, Python and other higher level languages. It needs slightly more auditing. I&#8217;m aiming for the following phases
  * 1) Simple single core md5 hasher (I&#8217;ll minimize function calls with function based macro&#8217;s and inline functions where applicable ( and any other nieve optimization&#8217;s I can think of).
  * 2) Posix Threads hasher
  * 3) OpenCl hasher

I&#8217;m still quite a beginner and I don&#8217;t think step 2 will be necessary. Perhaps it will, but not in the respect of my¬†initial¬†implementation intentions. I garner that at least a dedicated thread will need to lay around awaiting requests to hash certain files and feed them to OpenCL kernels.

Perhaps I&#8217;ll try various compilers too and see how it goes. I&#8217;ve got a few in mind such as

  * GCC
  * Intel Compiler
  * Digital Mars
  * Microsoft Compiler

<div>
  I&#8217;m open to suggestion here. ¬†Obviously I&#8217;ll try various compiler/linker settings and see how it goes. Does gcc -o3 really improve things over -o2 ? Probably not in the grand scheme of things due to binary size.
</div>

I&#8217;ve got a proclivity to keep heading towards my goals even though I don&#8217;t have enough time and today I found some useful sites to reinforce my knowledge. I good series of OpenCL articles I found on

  * <http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/110685/Part-1-OpenCL-Portable-Parallelism>

<div>
  I figure I&#8217;m going to have my work cut out for me in regards to workload size and transfers to the computing device. I&#8217;ll probably have to evaluate the size of the workload against the average time of transfer to the compute device as sometimes the transfer over the bus¬†precludes any computation at all. The time to transfer over earlier buses to older OpenCL compatible devices negates any transfer at all and is best done by a posix thread or other.

  That&#8217;s enough for today. I&#8217;m quite burnt out. I&#8217;ve got a wife and two daughters. They challenge me more than all my IT and Development hobbies combined. Especially the my youngest whom is 2.5 years old üôÇ

  Note &#8211; I&#8217;ve spent quite a while with the in-laws tonight and I consider myself a very lucky man. I&#8217;m exceedingly lucky to call them mum and dad !
