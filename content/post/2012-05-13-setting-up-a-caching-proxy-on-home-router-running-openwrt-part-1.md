### Why do this?

&nbsp;

  * AnÂ academicÂ exercise. I really like to learn and see how I can push my hardware. Hopefully myÂ educationÂ will assist me elsewhere.
  * Fun factor &#8211; I&#8217;m a computer nerd. I find it challenging and rewarding.
  * Save on bandwidth used , increase performance and do it all for minimal cost

&nbsp;

### Software/Hardware used

&nbsp;

  * OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r31576 [Â (GET IT HERE)Â ][1]
  * Polipo Caching proxyÂ <http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/>

&nbsp;

### Starting off

&nbsp;

### Guide

&nbsp;

#### Install OpenWRT

  2. Use the default Netgear interface to flash the firmware (below). Â Please click the Browse button and navigate to the file you have selected.

    #### Mount a flash drive for extra storage on your router
    
    &nbsp;
    
    #### Setup your modem in bridge mode and configure the wan port on your router to use PPOE/PPOA authentication
    
    &nbsp;
    
    #### Install Polipo (optware)
    
    &#8211; Test Polipo by setting the proxy in your web browser.
    
    #### Add rewrite rules for iptables so the proxying is transparent
