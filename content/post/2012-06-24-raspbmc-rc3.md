I&#8217;ve been using RC3 for a few days now and I must say it&#8217;s AWESOME. Decoding is fautless , speed is impressive. HDMI CEC is working on my Sonia Bravia TV (Although I&#8217;m interested in rewriting the way that the HDMI CEC commands are passed through to XBMC to use the [XBMC EventServer][1].

Thank you for all the hard work putting the &#8220;distro&#8221; together team raspbmc!
