I just found out that my wife&#8217;s website would no longer allow me to log and administer it. It was stuck in a weird redirect loop. Each time I attempted to log in it would show a bizzare url.

I tried the following process to resolve.

  * Rename the Plugins dirÂ temporarily (It failed. Obviously a/some plugins were crucial to the site working)
  * Manually [upgrading][1] WordPress
  * Deleting one plugin at a time.

Eventually I found out that deleting the [DB Cache Reloaded Fix][2] resulted in a blank page whilst removal of the other plugins wasn&#8217;t doing anything dramatic.

I figured perhaps the new WordPress build wasn&#8217;t compatible with that version of the Plugin. I ended up using the process below to resolve it.

[code language=&#8221;bash&#8221;]
  
ssh useratdomain.com
  
wget http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/db-cache-reloaded-fix.zip
  
unzip db-cache-reloaded-fix.zip
  
rm db-cache-reloaded-fix.zip
  
[/code]

I was right ! Following this I could now login and administer her site (after Upgrading the MySQL database too)

A quick rsync of the website in a working condition was now in-order ðŸ™‚

Hopefully this helps somebody.
