For some reason I was bored and felt like playing a game. Normally I‚Äôll
  
just boot into Arch Linux or the Hackintosh (I‚Äôm not much of a gamer).
  
Unlucky for me I got the dreaded ‚Äúbootmgr is missing message‚Äù.

Sigh. It‚Äôd probably be as simple as booting the Windows 7 disc and
  
Choosing Startup repair. Or so i thought‚Ä¶ I gave that a crack and failed.
  
Then I went down the bootrec /fixboot bootrec /RebuildBcd path and they
  
too failed. I found it quite interesting that the Windows Install wasn‚Äôt
  
showing up in the System Recovery Options as well.

The fix

Boot into GParted and mark the partition as bootable (how did this
  
get messed up ?)
      
Start the System Recovery again from the Windows 7 install disc
      
Follow the snippet from Microsoft‚Äôs site using the console in System
  
Recovery.
          
bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup
          
c:
          
cd boot
          
attrib bcd -s -h -r
          
ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old
          
bootrec /RebuildBcd
      
Reboot successfully üôÇ

Somewhere along the way I busted something when working with a triple boot
  
setup and I hadn‚Äôt been into Windows for a while so I didn‚Äôt notice. I
  
hope this helps somebody.
