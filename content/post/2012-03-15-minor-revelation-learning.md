It&#8217;s not  that I am too dumb to understand you. It&#8217;s not an absence of intellect or  the inability for intellectual acquisition. It&#8217;s a matter of exposure.

I believe that no matter who you are, based upon the flowing variables you can learn anything. The following does not express any level of precedence.

  *   Time &#8211; Don&#8217;t expect to learn things first go. Expect to flounder  and foresee improvement. We all start as babies and mature (hopefully) into some incarnation of adulthood.

  *  Motivation &#8211; It&#8217;s all about desire. Aim , Fire and hit that target. If you don&#8217;t want to with all of your heart it won&#8217;t happen. Think of a pirate aiming for a merchant ship laden with a chest of gold.

  * Environment &#8211; Facilitate an environment that is conducive to learning. Yep, that means less alcohol, and other &#8220;Supplements&#8221;  and more of the good stuff (Exercise, Diet, Rest) .

  * Predisposition &#8211; Perhaps you were born strong and quick and you are meant to play sport and succeed. There are others that are born to inquire, extract and even facilitate the extraction of the finer side of life in things (nerdy things). You will find that naturally you are good at some things and when you attempt other tasks only  find detriment.

My point is to experiment and find what you can contribute and be productive, without contributing and finding no benefit. The point of this blog is to reach out to your gray matter and enrich it ! If you have the temperament to kick ass in UFC do so. If you are meant to write some tight optimized assembler for various embedded environments also do so!

  *   The right teaching medium &#8211; Some learn by reading, some by listening, others by doing. You need to find out what is best for you. The wise words of the nerd on coffee even iterates that some people even learn by talking/teaching. One can only hope that our wives are continually striving for enlightenment :-). It doesn&#8217;t matter if you were born into an educational environment or an apathetic environment bust your heart out with what you have!

**The end result**

Let&#8217;s face it  you may have copious amounts of time, are sincerely  motivated,  are born in a family of overachievers,  have an inclination to be a rocket scientist and have infinite amounts of money or access to get that ultimate teacher but it&#8217;s not happening. In this case, you need to do some internal investigation and figure things out.

Please note that the above factors may take a life-time of refining. Be prepared to be late, encumbered in an in-conducive environment, find that you flat out SUCK at something or that you don&#8217;t have access to the appropriate avenues to teach you sufficiently and efficiently. Don&#8217;t let any of them detract you. Keep experimenting. Improve or eliminate the negative factors and encourage the positive ones. Never give in!

We all fail. We all succeed. I guess whilst typing this and throwing down some beers and sipping on a sweet white wine that I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that everything is a learning experience and that if I intend to improve day by day and If I do so (even marginally) then I&#8217;m a happy guy, along with having a great wife and some wonderful daughters. What more can a nerd on coffee ask for?

Probably more coffee !
